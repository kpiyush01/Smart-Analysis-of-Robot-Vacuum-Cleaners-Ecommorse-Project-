# Smart-Analysis-of-Robot-Vacuum-Cleaners-Ecommorse-Project-
Project Overview:
This Power BI dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of robot vacuum cleaners from various global brands. It is built using a structured and cleaned dataset of 9,000 entries, each representing a different model with its specifications and features.
The goal of this project is to:
Help users compare key specifications
Identify top-performing models
Understand feature trends
Analyze price-to-performance relationships

Dashboard Features & Visuals:
Key Metrics :
Average Battery Life (Minutes)
Average Price (USD)
Average Suction Power (Pa)
Number of Models per Brand

Charts & Visualizations:

Bar Chart: Top 10 Brands by Number of Models

Scatter Plot: Price vs Battery Life (Highlighting Value-for-Money Models)

Pie Charts:
Models with WiFi Connectivity
Availability of Self-Emptying Feature

Column Chart: Suction Power Distribution across Models

Heat Map: Feature Combination Popularity (e.g., Mop + Self Emptying + Mapping)

Filters/Slicers for Dynamic Exploration:
Brand
WiFi/App/Voice Control
HEPA Filter / Mop / Self-Emptying
Price Range
Suction Power Range
Battery Life Range

Clean Data Highlights:
Removed duplicates and inconsistent entries
Standardized feature fields (e.g., Yes/No values)
Fixed unit issues (e.g., converting time formats)
Ensured all numeric values are properly typed

Insights Derived:
High-performance models often offer Suction Power > 4000 Pa and Battery Life > 120 minutes.
Most models support App and Voice Control, but fewer have Self-Emptying and Multi-Floor Mapping.
Brands like Eufy, Dreame, and Samsung dominate the market in feature-rich models.
A significant price gap exists between basic and advanced models with similar suction but additional features.

Target Audience:
Product Analysts
Tech Retailers & Marketers
Consumers comparing robot vacuums
Engineering/Product Dev Teams

Tools Used:
Microsoft Power BI
Microsoft Excel (for initial data cleaning)
Pandas & Numpy (Python, for additional formatting)
